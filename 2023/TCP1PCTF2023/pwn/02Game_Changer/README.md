When the program is running, it will loop and call the `game()` function when the user enters the number 1. In the `game()` function, the user will be prompted to enter a number. If the number entered by the user is the same as the result of calling the `randomize()` function, the program will return to the `main()` function with a value of 1 (True).

In the `randomize()` function, the program will call `srand()` to set the randomization seed for the `rand()` function using the current time as an integer seed. This can be exploited to obtain the same random number as the result of calling the `randomize()` function.

Now let's take a look at the `ask()` function which will be called if the `game()` function return 1.  

```c
int ask()
{
  char buf[256]; // [rsp+0h] [rbp-100h] BYREF

  puts("Congrats, you guessed it correctly. What do you want to do this morning?");
  read(0, buf, 290uLL);
  if ( strlen(buf) <= 0x7F )
  {
    puts("Oh, are you an introverted person?");
    exit(0);
  }
  return printf("Oh, you want to %s...\nWow, you're a very active person!\n", buf);
}
```

The program will ask the user to input data with a maximum of 296 bytes, which will be stored in the variable `buf`. This creates a Buffer Overflow vulnerability because the `buf` variable can only hold up to 256 bytes of data. This can be leveraged to perform a Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) attack. However, due to the presence of Position-Independent Executable (PIE) mitigation in the provided binary, we cannot directly jump to the desired function. In this case, I decided to perform a brute force with a probability of 1/16 by overwriting the last 2 bytes (3 known nibbles and 1 unknown nibble) of the SAVED RIP on the stack with the address of the `main()` function. This is done with the aim of determining a valid address by observing if the program displays the output from the "main()" function.

Additionally, there is a vulnerability in the "ask()" function that can be exploited to leak an address.
```c
  return printf("Oh, you want to %s...\nWow, you're a very active person!\n", buf);
```
This vulnerability arises because the user's input received using the read() function is not terminating the user input using null byte. Therefore, if a user enters specific data, it possible the program to potentially display addresses and values stored in the stack. To clarify further, please refer to the image below.

When I tried to debug, I noticed that at the end of the `ask()` function the $RDI register was pointing to the stack address that contained the libc address of the `funlockfile()` function. 
![RDI Containing a LIBC Address](images/8ed3287d2b5190753e0fc66809c24efff11ab85a0c5757f1cf3a2f04c322aecf.png)  
Then, I had the idea to perform a libc address leak by calling the `printf()` function and testing it on the REMOTE server, which turned out to be successful. From there, I assumed that the server was running on Ubuntu 22.04 (GLIBC version 2.35). Honestly, I felt lucky because I was using Ubuntu 22.04, which has GLIBC version 2.35 xD.

After performing the leak, the payload I used is to return to the `ask()` function to perform ROP. Here, I decided to use a one-gadget because there is a suitable constraint to use after calling the `ask()` function:
```
0xefcf5 execve("/bin/sh", r10, rdx)
constraints:
address rbp-0x78 is writable
[r10] == NULL || r10 == NULL
[rdx] == NULL || rdx == NULL
```

Here's my exploit to solve this challenge:
